# sin-cos-tan-calculator
This calculator is made in C and doesn't use math.h library.

It works using Taylor Series to calculate the cos of the angle (in radians or degrees) and of the complementary that is the sin of the angle.
Tan is calculated using the property:
      tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)

It was made when I was starting my graduation, so it's not optimized and modularized as it could be.
If you want to practice your C skills, you can try to optimize and modularize this code.

Thanks for passing by!
